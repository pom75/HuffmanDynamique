 Tod Machover, known for many great technological contributions to music including the Hyperinstruments group, shared an interesting thought: "Traditional instruments are hard to play. It takes a long time to [acquire] physical skills which aren't necessarily the essential qualities of making music. It takes years just to get good tone quality on a violin or to play in tune. If we could find a way to allow people to spend the same amount of concentration and effort on listening and thinking and evaluating the difference between things and thinking about how to communicate musical ideas to somebody else, how to make music with somebody else, it would be a great advantage. Not only would the general level of musical creativity go up, but you'd have a much more aware, educated, sensitive, listening, and participatory public."(1999) 

With proper practice, an individual can control most variables of an instrument well and at very fast speeds. However, the initial performance accessibility of an instrument or control interface has definite implications for its use by individuals as a musical instrument; in particular, those individuals who lack formal musical training and those who have physical or mental impairments.  

Video game controllers are typically designed with mass accessibility in mind. Many early video games used joysticks and only a few buttons to control game play. Game controllers today are typically comfortable to hold with buttons and other switches positioned to allow the user to access them easily. Some developers of controllers such as NintendoÂ® have incorporated sophisticated sensors and gyroscope technology into their controllers to provide continuous data about the controller in addition to using buttons and switches. A few EEG-based game controllers exist that arent held, but worn on the head and controlled by measuring brain waves.

After I had created a few EAMIR patches, I began using the same basic program functionality with different types of video game controllers. In one lesson, one of my teaching objectives was to discuss things about functional harmony and how certain diatonic chord progressions functioned.

In a classroom of individuals with mixed levels of musicianship, I didnâ€™t want to spend the majority of my time focusing on how to play each chord in the progression on their instrumentâ€”that was something they could work on with their instrumental teacher, and some students didnâ€™t have an instrument. I wanted to discuss the chord itself and how it functioned among other chords in a given key. I wanted them to hear and experience the concept I was trying to explain and I didn't want them to miss it because of their lack of ability to demonstrate the concept themselves on a traditional instrument.  

At that time, the game Guitar HeroÂ® was becoming extremely popular. All of my students played the game and were familiar with its unique guitar-shaped controller. Naturally, I felt that using this controller to trigger chord functions would provide some of my students with an accessible control interface to perform with that they already knew how to use while allowing me to discuss my teaching objectives: chord functions. Plus, it's really cool looking!

In Max, I made a patch that mapped each of the first four buttons, in combination with the two-position flipper, to the eight chord functions of a given key. Button one pressed down with the flipper held down triggered the one chord, button one held down with the flipper held up triggered the two chord, and so on. The fifth button, in combination with the flipper, triggered one of two chord voicings: one that played a full root position "rhythm" triad and another that played only the single root note of each chord in a higher "lead" octave. The controller then had the ability to play chord functions and scales in any diatonic key starting on any tonic.

Since the controller was already familiar to the students, there was little instruction needed to explain how the instrument worked, and we were soon able to discuss chord progressions in terms of chord functions. Imagine my surprise when one of my students who couldnâ€™t (or wouldn't?) play a glockenspiel was able to tell me that he liked the sound of a â€œI V vi IV progression in E Majorâ€. Others enjoyed hearing how chord functions differed in more distant tonalities like Harmonic Minor and Lydian b7. I even made some specialized notation for the activity using the â€œcolored noteheadsâ€ feature in the notation software we used in which the arrow markings indicate which position to â€œstrumâ€ with the flipper.
